# Movie-Reccomendation-System
This project uses pairwise_distances from sklearn.metrics and creates a pivot table for the similarity matrix. 

Whichever movie you choose in this data set, the model gives you 5 similar movie recommendations in this data set. 

Note: You must write the full name of the movies and check the excel files for the full name of the movies. 

How it works : Run the code and then write full name of the movie in console section.

This project is example for the Collaborative Filtering in the Recommendation Systems.
